            <h3>How the magic happened</h3>
            <p>In the 1861, Crapper was a sanitary engineer, with his own brass foundry and various other shops in England. There Thomas began to build many different plumbing supplys with his 9 patents. 3 of the 9 were water closet improvements that helped shape what we know as the toilet today.</p>

            <h3>The 1880's for Crapper</h3>
            <p>In the 1880's Prince Edward purchased a home and requested the services of Thomas Crapper & Co. to supply the plumbing for his home, including 30 lavatories thus giving Thomas his first Royal notice. This job only furthered his name in infamy in relation to the toilet.</p>
